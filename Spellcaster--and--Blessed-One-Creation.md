To create a spellcaster or blessed one, drag and drop an entity of one of the following categories onto you character sheet:

Blessed One:
* Liturgy
* Ceremony
* Blessing
* Clerical Special Ability

Spellcaster:
* Spell
* Ritual
* Cantrip
* Magical Special Ability

To enable the calculation of Arcane Energy or Karma Points you have to make sure:
* To add a species
* To select your Primary Attribute for the tradition on the religion/magic tab
* And optionally to add an advantage which adds Arcane Energy or Karma Points, like Spellcaster or Blessed

You can take the advantage from the predefined core module compendium or you can create one yourself.
For the latter make sure to enter in the effect field
* +20 AsP or +20 KaP (german)
* +20 AE or +20 KP (english)
This will add the number to your maximum Arcane Energy or Karma Points.
