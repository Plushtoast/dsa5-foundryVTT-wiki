# Preparation: Install game system and modules.
Before creating a new world for DSA5, the game system must be installed. 
1. first *game systems* -> *install system*.
2. then enter dsa in the field *search packages*.
3. via *install* the character sheet and the associated rules will be installed  
![Spielsystem installieren](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80099175/111484055-aec38e00-8735-11eb-9c3c-670bdc66fbf5.png)
 
The quick starter is free as a module and can also be installed directly. With this you have already created a few characters and an adventure 
and you can get into the system a little bit easier.
1. first *Add-on Module* -> *Install Module*.
2. then you enter dsa in the field *search packages*.
3. about *install* the module is installed must be activated then however in the world still manually! See **Initialize DSA 5 Quickstarter and Rules**.

# Create DSA 5 world
To create a new world, go to the Foundry Admin menu and select *Game Worlds* (1) -> *Create World* (2).
Here you have to enter the name of the world (3), the path in which the world will be saved (4) and the rules system (5). 
(Important: For DSA *The Dark Eye (5th Edition)*) must be selected (5).

# Initialize DSA 5 Quickstarter and Rulebook
After starting a world, you can log in as Gamemaster (*Select Player*) (*Join Game Session*).
After that you may get the message Language settings. Here you can choose between *de* for German and *en* for English.
![Auswahl Sprache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80099175/111479150-001d4e80-8731-11eb-9b5c-753ad24bd892.png)

Next the Quickstarter module must be activated. Otherwise the DSA 5 character sheets and a few compendium contents are available, 
but everything has to be rebuilt.
1. click on the cogwheel (*game settings*) -> *manage modules*.
2. check the box in front of *The Dark Eye - Introduction Adventure* and click on *Update Modules*.

3. when setting the checkmark a dependency message may appear. This should always be confirmed with *Yes*:  
![Abhängigkeiten](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80099175/111480895-bd5c7600-8732-11eb-8fe8-554389cd4839.png)
4. as soon as the world has reloaded, a window appears with short instructions and an initialization. Here click on *Initialize*. 
This will copy all the contents of the module into the respective categories (scenes, actors, notes, etc.).  
![Initialisieren](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80099175/111483176-db2ada80-8734-11eb-9600-5dc837899aa4.png)
The initialization can also be repeated via the gear wheel (*Settings*) on the top right -> *Customize Settings* -> *Module Settings* 
-> *The Dark Eye - Introduction Adventure* -> *Initialize*.  
This is only necessary if you clicked away the dialog the first time. 
If you just do this again, the entries will be copied to the categories again and will be duplicated.
